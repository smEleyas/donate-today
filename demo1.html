                    Save the Children said the floods had "washed away homes, schools and livelihoods," damaging at
                    least 93,000 homes and 419 primary schools in Sylhet in May alone.

                    Torrential rain has caused rivers in Bangladesh -- a densely populated delta nation -- to overflow,
                    submerging areas that border the Indian state of Meghalaya, according to the International
                    Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

                    Some 94% of Bangladesh's Sunamganj town and 84% of the surrounding Sylhet district are now
                    submerged, the IFRC said. Roads leading to the region have been largely cut off and there are power
                    cuts even in areas not underwater.
